-   triple check for file input type
-   key state to reset input
-   talk about file size

-   Users should be able to upload an image (JPG or PNG format).
-   The uploaded image should be displayed in the UI.
-   The uploaded image should be stored in the BE either on the local filesystem or some
    bucket alternative so it can be retrieved

-   Users should be able to apply basic manipulations to the image, such as:
-   Rotate the image (90 degrees at a time).
-   Scale the image (zoom in/out).
-   Reset the image to its original state

Bonus

-   Add Drag and drop capabilities in the image upload component.
-   Implement additional image manipulation features, such as flipping the image
    (horizontally/vertically).
-   Add undo/redo functionality for applied transformations.
-   Add a feature to draw on top of the image

Future improvements

-   count drawings as manipulations
-   add multiple brush sizes
-   filters
-   apply the same transformations to the drawing canvas
